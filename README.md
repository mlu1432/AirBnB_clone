# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Introduction

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project, an ambitious endeavor to replicate the functionality and design of the original AirBnB platform. "The Console" is the foundation of this project, acting as a custom command interpreter designed to manage the core functionalities of the AirBnB objects. This includes creating, updating, storing, and managing various entities like users, places, states, cities, amenities, and reviews. This component is crucial as it lays the groundwork for subsequent stages of the project, including the web front-end, database integration, API development, and more.
